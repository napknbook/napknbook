Napknbook is a tool for creating Imaginary Empires. 

It can be used to create Internet Maps and is also a marketplace 
for Imaginary Assets. 

## Internet Maps 

Internet maps are an extension of mind maps to the internet. 

Mind maps are mappings from images to ideas. Internet maps are mappings from 
images to ideas and data.

Internet maps are the next layer of abstraction that sit ontop of search engines.

## Imaginary Assets

A few examples are:

Imaginary Estate - property consisting of the pixels of some internet map.   

Imaginary Labour - work that can be done using just a computer. 

Badges - a token that any user can create and give to another. 

## The Great Wall of America 

Napknbook gives the user the freedom to determine which users are a part of their internet. 

This is done using badges. A user can filter through all the accounts using badges
they trust and can select which accounts matter to them.
