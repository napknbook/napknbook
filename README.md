A tool for creating Imaginary Empires. 

NapknBook can be used to create Internet Maps and is also a marketplace 
for Imaginary Assets. 

## Internet Maps 

Internet maps are an extension of mind maps to the internet. 

A mind map is a mapping from an image to some idea. An internet map 
is a mapping from an image to some idea as well as some data.

Internet maps are the next layer of abstraction. 

## Imaginary Assets 

An imaginary asset is an asset that isn't real.

A few examples are:

### Imaginary Estate

Imaginary estate is property consisting of the pixels of some internet map.  

### Imaginary Currency

Imaginary currency is money that isn't backed by any real asset, like gold or oil. 

Bitcoin isn't real, but that doesn't mean it has no value. It's ortho-real, it's 
imaginary. It has value in a different dimension. 

The USD also isn't real, but unlike bitcoin, it's centralized. The USD is 
a centralized imaginary currency. 

### Imaginary Labour 

Imaginary labour is labour that can be done using just a keyboard and a mouse. 

### Badges 

A badge is just a token that any user can create and give to another user. 

The 'twitter verified' badge is a good example of a badge. The problem with twitter
is that they have a monopoly on badges. Napknbook democratises the ability to create 
badges. 

## The Great Wall of America 

Napknbook gives the user the freedom to select which users can influence the content
they see. 

This can be done using badges. A user can filter through all the accounts using badges
they trust and can select which accounts matter to them.
